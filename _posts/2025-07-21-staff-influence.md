Progressing from Senior Engineer to Staff is rarely just another extension of responsibility and/or scope; it is often a completely different role requiring a very different set of skills. Generally every Senior Engineer being considered for a Staff role will have demonstrated they have the mastery to make sensible technical decisions and the experience to lead fellow engineers. However the role requires advanced development of soft skills not traditionally expected or necessarily required at more junior levels. These are particularly important at staff level as conversations are often with people without an engineering background who sit at escalated levels of seniority. Skills such as:
- **effective communication**: 
- **collaboration**: the ability to bring people with varying opinions, experience and expertise together to solve problems or explore ideas
- **domain expertise**:

While these skills are undoubtedly needed and are important, experience has shown me that one particular skill is the most crucial of all and that is the ability to **influence**. All of the most effective and successful technical leaders I have worked with have it and leverage it often. Influence, at its core, is the capacity or power to affect or change the actions, behavior, opinions, or decisions of others, typically in an indirect or intangible way, without the direct use of force or command. 

While you might be worried that you don't possess it currently, fear not! Influence is something that can be learned and refined over time with practice. It is a sophisticated combination of multiple soft skills and qualities including some outlined above:
- **Communication**: Clear, concise, and persuasive verbal and non-verbal communication is fundamental. This includes active listening, asking insightful questions, and tailoring your message to your audience.
- **Empathy**: The ability to understand and share the feelings of another. This allows you to see situations from their perspective and tailor your approach to resonate with their needs and motivations.
- **Trust Building and Credibility**: This involves demonstrating honesty, integrity, consistency, and competence. People are more likely to be influenced by those they trust and respect.
- **Persuasion**: The art of convincing others to adopt your viewpoint or take a desired action through logical arguments, emotional appeals, and credibility.
- **Negotiation**: The skill of reaching mutually agreeable solutions, often involving compromise and finding common ground.
- **Emotional Intelligence**: Understanding and managing your own emotions, as well as recognizing and responding appropriately to the emotions of others, is vital for building rapport and trust.
- **Strategic Thinking**: Understanding the broader context, identifying key stakeholders, and anticipating potential objections or opportunities.
- **Relationship Building**: Cultivating strong, positive relationships with colleagues, clients, and superiors creates a foundation for influence.
- **Observation and Active Listening**: Being able to read situations, body language, and group dynamics to gauge how your ideas might be received.

Influence is not just a top down thing. Technical leaders with the ability to influence up, down and across disciplines are the most effective.
