# About

Hi everyone!

I'm currently a Staff (Software) Engineer with [Trustpilot](https://www.trustpilot.com/ "Trustpilot's Homepage") and live just outside Edinburgh in Scotland. I've previously worked at a number of different organisations covering a variety of industries.

I've created this blog as a platform to share some of the opinions I've formed (which are open to change) along with experiences and expertise I've collated over the years in the hope they might be of interest to others. I also hope it'll help me become a better writer. Ultimately this is very new to me and so you should expect it to be rough around the edges at the very least. I do.
