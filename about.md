# About

Hi everyone!

I'm currently a Staff (Software) Engineer with [Trustpilot](https://www.trustpilot.com/ "Trustpilot's Homepage") and live just outside Edinburgh with my wife and two sons. I have previously worked at a number of different organisations covering a variety of industries.

I created this blog as a platform to share some of the opinions I've formed (which should definitely be challenged) along with experiences and expertise I have collated over the years in the hope they might be of interest to others. I also hope it'll help me with my writing.

Ultimately this is very new to me and so you should expect it to be rough around the edges at the very least. I definitely do.
